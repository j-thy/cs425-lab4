    "# Introduction\n",
    "# In this lab, you will be practicing using linear regression, SVMs, and applying them to\n",
    "# datasets. Here, our dataset for linear regression will be Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Ma-\n",
    "# chine Learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg. The\n",
    "# actual CSV for the dataset you will be using is available on Canvas for download. Our\n",
    "# dataset for SVM will be the Star Type Classification from NASA, available here and on\n",
    "# Canvas: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/star-type-classification\n",
    "# You will create a Jupyter notebook for each part that you will submit where you will put the\n",
    "# code that you wrote for this lab. You will also submit a separate written report in PDF form\n",
    "# in which you include the answers to the questions and/or plots required by the question.\n",
    "# Note: For all plots, you should include axes labels and titles.\n",
    "# Part 1: Linear Regression\n",
    "# Read in the auto-mpg.csv dataset using pandas and create the y label vector that we will use\n",
    "# throughout, which will be the MPG column. The features we will be using for regression are\n",
    "# the columns cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration. You will ignore\n",
    "# the model-year, origin, and car-name columns. Anywhere you are asked to create a train-test\n",
    "# split on the data, you should use a fixed random state throughout (noted in your write-up)\n",
    "# and a test size=0.2.\n",
    "# Question 1.1 (60 points – 12 points for each feature): For each of the five features (cylinders,\n",
    "# displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration), do the following:\n",
    "# •Create an X matrix where each row is the current feature of interest.\n",
    "# •Do the train test split as indicated above. Create a plot that shows the current feature\n",
    "# on the x-axis and the MPG on the y-axis for the training data.\n",
    "# •In the report, note whether you expect linear regression will perform well using that\n",
    "# feature to predict the MPG value and why you believe it will perform well or not\n",
    "# perform well.\n",
    "# •Use sklearn’s LinearRegression() to fit to the training data.\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# •Create a prediction vector based on the training data, and calculate and print the\n",
    "# mean-squared error and the R2score using sklearn on the training set.\n",
    "# •Create a prediction vector based on the testing data, and calculate and print the\n",
    "# mean-squared error and the R2score using sklearn on the testing set.\n",
    "# •Print the coefficient and intercept parameters from the sklearn model for that feature.\n",
    "# •Plot the line created from that linear regression along with points for the training data\n",
    "# (as one color) and the testing data (as another color). Include a legend to denote which\n",
    "# are training and which are testing. Note that the x-axis should be the feature you’re\n",
    "# predicting on and the y-axis should be MPG.\n",
    "# In the report, note which of the features you believe is best for predicting MPG and why\n",
    "# you selected that feature.\n",
    "# Question 1.2 (10 points): Combining all of the data, do the following:\n",
    "# •Create an X matrix that includes all five features.\n",
    "# •Do the train test split as indicated above.\n",
    "# •Use sklearn’s LinearRegression() to fit to the training data.\n",
    "# •Create a prediction vector based on the training data, and calculate and print the\n",
    "# mean-squared error and the R2score using sklearn.\n",
    "# •Create a prediction vector based on the testing data, and calculate and print the\n",
    "# mean-squared error and the R2score using sklearn.\n",
    "# Does using all of the data improve performance over using each of the features individually?\n",
    "# Part 2: SVM\n",
    "# Read in the Stars.csv dataset using pandas and create the y label vector, which will be the\n",
    "# Type column. The features we will be using for prediction are the columns Temperature, L,\n",
    "# R, and A M. Anywhere you are asked to create a train-test split on the data, you should use\n",
    "# a fixed random state throughout (noted in your write-up) and a test size=0.2. Use a fixed\n",
    "# random state for the LinearSVC classifier throughout.\n",
    "# Question 2.1 (25 points): Finding hyperparameters:\n",
    "# •Create a validation set and subtraining set from the training set (a single validation\n",
    "# set, rather than KFolds) with 0.125 of the training set serving as the validation set.\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# •Fit the LinearSVC classifier on the training set and evaluate on the validation set for\n",
    "# all combinations of max iter=[1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000] and C=[0.01, 0.1, 1, 10,\n",
    "# 100, 1000].\n",
    "# •Print the validation accuracy for each combination and show a heatmap comparing of\n",
    "# the validation accuracies across the combinations (include a colorbar).\n",
    "# •Note the best parameter combination and discuss why those parameter values might\n",
    "# be the best for this dataset (1-3 sentences).\n",
    "# Question 2.2 (5 points): Use the maximum iterations and C values you found to perform\n",
    "# best to inform how you create your LinearSVC() and fit on the whole training set. Compute\n",
    "# and print the training and testing accuracy for the Stars dataset.\n",
    "# Submission Checklist\n",
    "# In this lab, you will submit on Canvas:\n",
    "# •Jupyter notebook for part 1\n",
    "# •Jupyter notebook for part 2\n",
    "# •PDF of your report\n",
